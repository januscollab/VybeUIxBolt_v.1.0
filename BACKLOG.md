## 🎨 Figma Integration Feature (Added to Backlog)

### Epic: Automatic Figma Design System Setup
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days  

#### User Stories:
1. **As a designer, I want to automatically create a Figma file** with my design system structure so I don't have to manually set up pages and components.

2. **As a design system maintainer, I want to sync component URLs** between my DLS and Figma so both systems stay connected.

3. **As a team member, I want design tokens exported to Figma** so designers and developers use consistent values.

#### Technical Requirements:
- [ ] Figma API token management via Supabase secrets
- [ ] Edge function for secure API communication  
- [ ] Automatic file creation with proper structure
- [ ] Component placeholder generation
- [ ] URL synchronization back to database
- [ ] Design token export in Figma-compatible format
- [ ] Error handling and user feedback

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] User can click "Create Figma File" and get a fully structured file
- [ ] All categories become Figma pages
- [ ] All components become Figma component placeholders
- [ ] Shareable URLs are automatically collected and stored
- [ ] Design tokens are exported for Figma plugin compatibility
