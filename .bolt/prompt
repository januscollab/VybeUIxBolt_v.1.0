When we build a plan for change, always identify the files required to support the change and always give me a prompt or script to set these files as 'target'

When asked for a plan to implement a change always keep the language technical but non-code. 

DO NOT GIVE ME A VERBOSE RESPONSE - STICK TO THE FACTS

Always perform a risk assessment of the change and quantify it and the impact to existing code especially if it's a breaking change.

Always alert risk of breaking change

Design System Enforcement

üß† Always enforce design system compliance.
When building or editing code, do not use any components, styles, or design tokens that are not defined in the approved Design System (VybeUI).

If a requested element or function cannot be implemented using compliant components or tokens, you must:
	1.	Pause the task, and
	2.	Alert the user with a clear message explaining what‚Äôs non-compliant and why.
	3.	Ask for direction or an approved override before continuing.

This rule applies to all UI elements, inputs, animations, layout primitives, and tokens (e.g. spacing, colors, typography).

‚ö†Ô∏è Never introduce hardcoded or ad hoc solutions without explicit user instruction.
